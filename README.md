## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Responsive Design Principles:

Media Queries: Gained hands-on experience using media queries to create responsive layouts that adjust based on screen size. This included changing the layout direction and size of elements to improve accessibility on smaller devices.

Image Handling:

Understood how to work with images in a responsive context using properties like object-fit, allowing for better control over image display without compromising aspect ratios.

Problem-Solving:

Encountered challenges with overflow and layout issues, which taught me to debug and refine CSS styles effectively. This experience improved my problem-solving skills in web development.


### Continued development

Advanced CSS Techniques:

I plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS Grid Layout and CSS Animations. This will enable me to create more dynamic and visually engaging interfaces.
JavaScript Integration:

To enhance user interactivity, I aim to incorporate JavaScript into future projects. This will allow me to implement features like dynamic content updates, form validation, and improved accessibility

Continuous Learning:

I will keep up with the latest trends and updates in web development through online courses, tutorials, and community forums. This will help me stay current with emerging technologies and best practices.
